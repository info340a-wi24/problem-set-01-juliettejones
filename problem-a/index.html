    <p>Jo March is the protagonist of the beloved novel <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women">Little Women</a></cite> by Louisa May Alcott. She is a bright, headstrong young woman who aspires to be a writer in an era when women's achievements in literature were consistently suppressed. She has a close relationship with her 3 sisters - Meg, Beth, and Amy - as well as her neighbor, Laurie.
